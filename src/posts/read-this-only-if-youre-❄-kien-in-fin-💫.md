sometimes i think letters are overrated. considering the fact that i used to write letters to a significant amount of people who turned out to be unworthy of my time.

but this is for you. and you've always been worthy of my everything. and i know you're not anyone else but you. and i know that you're the one for me.

also vice versa.

anyways, it's the end of 2023. believe it or not, we've been through the good, the bad, the ugly together, all in this year. and as of today, i'm dead-on-the-floor grateful to still have you by my side. we made it through this year!!

seriously, i'm so glad that we didn't miss each other once again. i'm so glad that we decided to turn around and stay.

thank you for trusting me all along.

thank you for always being so supportive.

for example: when i had 58% for an assignment =))))) thank you for not judging and being so supportive of every of my rants and was there for me from the beginning. thank you for not seeing me as a failure and for helping me to look over it in a positive way. I PROMISE IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME

again, thank you for being supportive of me. even though i'm sure you'd be disappointed seeing me playing basketball on the court (i suck ass at lay-ups). but thank you for not judging any of my ambitions.

thank you for reading all of my stuff and not for once ever judged. i know i write stuff that aren't your cup of tea but i know you didn't read it because of that, you read it because i wrote it. and that's what i'd think about every night before sleep and giggle til' i fall off the bed.

thank you for always listening to my wishes and fulfilling it in any possible ways that you can. like when you helped me with my assignment or when you created a bunch of lovely blogs for me just to vent.

thank you for always complimenting me and everything i do. i never had to ask for it. and it makes me feel like the luckiest girl in the world.

thank you for taking your time to find out what i like. the fact that you watched hamburger hill and researched about bologna will always be something i'd never stop bragging people about. thank you for being so supportive of my passions even though they have nothing to do with you and they're not that productive for me either. but thank you for not ever once judged.

it's utmost important to have someone who shares my thoughts and be so enthusiastic about my interests. also someone who's dead-ass supportive and believes in me more than i do.

i think i found that one. it's you. i love you.

in the mean time, until we meet again, until i get to touch you again, i'd try my best to be that person of yours too. i'd try to be better as a person and as anything that i'm trying to be.

and you. you've been wonderful. you've been better than anything i could've ever asked for. i know things aren't easy for you (that's what you told me and what i know at the moment), but i also know that you're trying really hard. and you look so hot when you're fighting to achieve your goals. so i believe in you and every decision you make. i know that whatever you decide has already been thoughtfully considered and i know that it will turn out good eventually. i believe in you and you should believe in yourself too.

so if we're both trying for us, let it be something mutual. i want to be someone who worths your values. and i will not stop trying until i get to see you again and we get to fight for each other's and our future together.

i'm now doing another assignment even though it's not really due that soon. i pulled out my laptop in the middle of a friends' outing yesterday because an academic guilt wave hit me out of a sudden and because i thought that i should work harder to be a better person for you to love.

so yeah. that's all i've got to say.

until next time, take care.

you're still the one i love from time to time.
