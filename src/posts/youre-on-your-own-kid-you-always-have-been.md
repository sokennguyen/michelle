the feeling of social disconnectedness is so real. sometimes i wake up and feel like initiating conversation with people is so exhausting. sometimes i stare at 10+ unopened messages on the screen and turn off my phone. sometimes i stare at one of my unfinished stories on the note app, then switch to another social media app only to scroll meaninglessly through stuff that i'm sure i've seen at least once. sometimes i actually think that shutting up in any given conversation that involves 2 or more people is not that bad after all.



for what it's worth: i've been living in gmt+2 and gmt+1. probably that's why i'm so disconnected with my real gmt+7. my morning is always their midnight. and all the best things occur during my late nights, which probably explains why i can't turn off my phone to go to sleep for christ's sake, even it's already 2 or 3 in the night.



anyways. basketball has been tough. i had a conversation with my team captain yesterday's training and i was on the verge of tears the whole time. kkk, the incident speaks for itself enough.



also, i started something out of excitement and unresolved hype. i'm sure gonna regret doing so by june 2024, but whatever. the whole point is to have fun at this very moment. key take-away: nothing lasts forever, and some day your feelings are gonna betray you. nobody's gonna die if you enjoy this current moment with it tho, so be it. whatever happens happens anyways.



kkk lâu lâu định tản mạn j đó mà nghĩ lại thấy óc sáng tạo của mình dạo này như óc heo. nên thôi tới đó được gòi, hài lòng chấp nhận với mọi thứ và mọi người.



mong những ngày sắp tới sẽ tươi sáng hơn thế này nhé.



even the sky was rossoblu.
