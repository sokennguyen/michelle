dạo này thích nghe rap trung quốc và đi ngoài đường chạy xe siêu chậm (trừ những lúc trễ làm thì rồ ga 60km/h như đi giựt nợ), chắc tại iu đời. bữa cũng ngồi nghiệm ra bên bờ hồ là, lúc yêu đúng người thì trong đầu cũng không nghĩ gì mấy (trừ mấy cái delusions về tương lai tươi đẹp). yêu đời yêu người nên là đi xe ngoài đường cũng đi cà rề cà rề, vừa vặn ga vừa rap theo lời bài bad boy cypher. thấy cũng ziệu cũng zâm. 

âm nhạc dạo này: bad boy cypher (恶童Cypher) !!!!! 身骑白马 (thân cưỡi bạch mã). if the world was ending (jp saxe). glory (bastille). excuse me for only listen to socially unacceptable music. 

my anger issues have been decreasing lately (unfuckingbelievable). i don't go through extreme anger episodes as much as before. and in case i do, it usually goes by really fast. i don't know why (probably the boyfriend effect), but it's good to not have to think about how much therapy is going to cost anymore. at least for now. 

and they say (cụ thể là nhỏ mèo nate fick trong generation kill), "observe everything, admire nothing". kiểu kiểu như là, "appreciate everything, expect nothing" đó. to put it simple: nobody owes anybody anything. the feeling of disappointment mostly derives from failed hopes and unmet expectations. get rid of those and then you'll be fine. perhaps the only person that you can expect anything from is yourself. but if that also means that you can be disappointed with yourself then again, you don't owe this life anything. 

i'm actually disappointed that i can't be happier than this. 

dạo gần đây còn bị 1 hội chứng lạ: l.t.r.o.a.f.m.d.y.m.f.t.w.w (let the result of a match determines your mood for the whole week). i spent a considerable amount of time overthinking on how the fuck did bologna play so badly against udinese the other day. but still, one bad outcome doesn't throw away the whole process. i've been learning (nói là have been chứ cũng 1 năm r đó quý vị khán giả) how to accept people (and of course a favorite football team) the way they are. that includes: love someone through their good, their bad, their ugly; love someone not because of their one single moment of glory but their journey and every baby steps they take; and love someone because they're them, not anyone else.

it's their quarter-finals this wednesday at 3am. i'm scared as fuck. i'd happily sacrifice 10 years of my enemy's life-time for their victory. 

i don't think at this point i'd love any other team but bologna. and i love them because they're them, because saelemaekers is here, not because they've been playing unbelievably well from the beginning of the season. and of course sometimes they fuck up (e.g., ông cố nội posch phạm lỗi ngay vòng cấm quá nhảm, thằng quỷ kristiansen 1 trận mất bóng 700 lần ngay giữa sân, zirkzee bắn chim, fabbian điều phối bóng quá gớm, urbanski xử lý bóng siêu chậm, thằng sae múa chân cho cố xong cũng mất bóng, thằng ferg 5 thẻ vàng bị cấm đá,...). but still, i chose to love them from the beginning. i'd embrace their mistakes (hơi miễn cưỡng 1 tí) because that's the only way i deserve to be with them when they're happy and successful.

the same notion can be applied in love and relationships. that's why i'm happy and we're happy (trộm vía). i love him because he's him, not anyone else. nói nhiều quá thì thành thừa dù i swear i'd never say that enough. nhưng mà là vậy đó. 

okay that's for this week. can't fucking believe that it's monday again and it's a new week again at this shithole rmit. i swear to god i'd do anything it takes to get out of here by this year. 

agenda for today and for this week: finish my lab report, finish my literature review, practice 25 hours a day, conduct a research on how the hell is sam beukema really existing as a human being not an angel, be happy be loveable and conclude my joevin's newest idea.

that'd be all. 

trân trọng!!
