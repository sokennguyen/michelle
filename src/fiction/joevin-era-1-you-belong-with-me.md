 🦋🤡

The first time Joe Belestky met Vincent Languilli was in fourth grade, when he asked to borrow an eraser and Vincent said if he ever talked to him again, he would stab him in the eyes with a Staedler pencil. The second time Joe Beletsky met Vincent Languilli was in twelfth grade, when Joe messed with someone at school and Vincent was asked to beat the shit out of him. He didn’t get a chance to do so though, despite having playing tag you’re it with Joe for possibly two-third of the neighborhood. And before Joe got a glimpse of it, the third time he met Vincent Languilli was already in his messy bedroom, naked, panting, clothes laying randomly on the sticky floor, sharing the same blanket to temporarily cover their bare-naked bodies from the homophobic sight of Vincent's dad. 

"Fuck you Beletsky", Vincent said as he threw Joe his clothes, struggling to put on his own pants as if his backdoor was still burning. "Yeah, we just did that, so fuck you Languilli", Joe chuckled, put on his flannel before glanced at Vincent again. A brief silence enveloped the room after they both dressed, interrupted only when Vincent stared at Joe dead in the eyes and said, "Kiss me and I'll scoop your eyeballs out."

That was it. That was the first time they had sex. Or banged each other, in Vincent's extreme choice of vocabulary. It usually started with Vincent hastily take off Joe's clothes, and ended with him threaten to take out a certain part of Joe's body if he ever dared to kiss him. Up until their first ever kiss, which didn’t take place until months later, Vincent had never let Joe anywhere near his lips. “Don’t kiss me, it’s fucking gay”, Vincent scoffed as he pulled up his pants, after yet another time he and Joe had sex with each other in either his room or under the creaky staircase of the school sports hall. “You literally just let me go up your ass. That ain’t gay but kissing is?”, Joe cackled, reached out his hand to touch Vincent’s face before getting shoved away with a middle finger. “Fuck yeah. Whatever. I’m not gay, you are.”, Vincent hissed and walked away, “See ya.”.

Vincent got sent to juvenile detention center not long after that, for something about being involved with a neighborhood infamous drug dealer. Joe wasn’t too surprised. The tradition of going to juvie and prison had been running in the Languilli’s family for ages. He wasn't too surprised with himself either, especially when he decided to put some money into Vincent’s commissary account and took a long ass bus ride to visit him in Camden County. 

Vincent was shocked to see Joe being on the other side of the glass pane, probably because Joe was the first one to actually go visit him in juvie and later, would be the only one who ever cared about him enough to do so. 

“What’s up?”, Joe spoke to the phone, couldn’t help but have his eyes constantly fixed on Vincent. He looked ridiculously hotter in juvie uniform than in the dirty but rarely washed daily clothes that he wore every day. “Not much could be up in juvie, Beletsky.”, Vincent hissed, looking from left to right to see if there was any familiar faces in this room, “If I behave and don’t cause any trouble, I could be out in less than a year.” 

“Like what trouble?”

“Like chopping off the balls of that dumbfuck Josh who kept stealing my peanut butter!”, Vincent shouted out loud, which was pretty much deliberate, as immediately after there was a shout back, probably from that dumbfuck Josh who then threatened to stab Vincent with a fork in his sleep that night. 

Joe giggled at the scene, catching Vincent’s eyes in between his glances. Vincent was probably too stunned to speak, and like what Joe had come to conclusion earlier, his IQ and EQ were lower than the bare minimum, so nobody was really expecting if Vincent would know how to behave in certain social contexts. This context was a bit weirder than usual though, marking Joe's first time ever travelling to visit someone in juvie. Came to think of that, Joe couldn’t help but beam at Vincent, who then glared back at him with a puzzled look, especially when Joe moved the phone closer to his mouth and softly whispered, “I miss you.”

“That’s seriously and criminally so gay, Beletsky”, Vincent stared at Joe in absolute disbelief, “You say that one more time and I’ll crush your sinuses”.

Joe kept smiling, even though Vincent had just literally threatened to take out yet another part of his body. That was one of the most memorable events of the year. Joe didn’t know if he would keep on waiting for Vincent after that, but history proved that he did, and history proved that that was indeed the right decision.
