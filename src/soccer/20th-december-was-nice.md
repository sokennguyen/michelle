apparently i got 4 hours of sleep last night but today was good.

* the lecturer praised my presentation. 
* we held an illegal karaoke party in the school's theater.
* practice was nice today. did 7 3-pointers and my lay-ups have improved kakakakakaka

bologna is playing tonight. 3 games in a week, unusual for what they're used to but the ragazzi will do just fine. they're playing against inter in giuseppe meazza. they managed to have a 2-2 draw at the same place 2 months ago (like it was literally impossible to do so but they did). so yeah everybody move move moveee

SHIT just realized that bologna is playing inter milan tonight. which means my baby saelemaekers is playing against my football husband benjamin pavard!!! it's giving a má»™t máº¥t má»™t cÃ²n vibe. either of them will have to cry tonight and i'm torn in between =))))))))))

anyways... 

rumors are spreading about how coach motta isn't gonna extend his contract. my happiness with this team might gonna last for only 5 more months and i'm fully aware of it. it's too soon to get ahead of myself, but so far i'm enjoying the moments i have with this team to the fullest. regardless of what's left by the end of the season, we have today, and we have had this whole season together. i'll forever remember how they've been making me scream at the top of my lungs at 3am almost every weekend. and nothing's ever promised in football, but what we've had together has been beautiful. 

for the next 5 months, we're gonna give our fullest.

forza bolognaaaa ðŸ’–ðŸ’™
